# TextStyle class Null safety #

An immutable style describing how to format and paint text.

### Bold ###

 *link* 

Sample

Here, a single line of text in a Text widget is given a specific style override. The style is mixed with the ambient DefaultTextStyle by the Text widget.

![Applying the style in this way creates bold text.][]

*assignment*

    Text(
      'No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan.',
      style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    )

### Italics ###

 *link* 

Sample

As in the previous example, the Text widget is given a specific style override which is implicitly mixed with the ambient DefaultTextStyle.

![This results in italicized text.][]

*assignment*

    Text(
      "Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation.",
      style: TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
    )

### Opacity and Color ###

Each line here is progressively more opaque. The base color is material.Colors.black, and Color.withOpacity is used to create a derivative color with the desired opacity. The root TextSpan for this RichText widget is explicitly given the ambient DefaultTextStyle, since RichText does not do that automatically. The inner TextStyle objects are implicitly mixed with the parent TextSpan's TextSpan.style.

If color is specified, foreground must be null and vice versa. color is treated as a shorthand for `Paint()..color = color`.

If backgroundColor is specified, background must be null and vice versa. The backgroundColor is treated as a shorthand for `background: Paint()..color = backgroundColor`.

![This results in three lines of text that go from lighter to darker in color.][]

    RichText(
      text: TextSpan(
        style: DefaultTextStyle.of(context).style,
        children: <TextSpan>[
          TextSpan(
            text: "You don't have the votes.\n",
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.6)),
          ),
          TextSpan(
            text: "You don't have the votes!\n",
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.8)),
          ),
          TextSpan(
            text: "You're gonna need congressional approval and you don't have the votes!\n",
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(1.0)),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    )

### Size ###

 *link* 

Sample

In this example, the ambient DefaultTextStyle is explicitly manipulated to obtain a TextStyle that doubles the default font size.

![This results in text that is twice as large as normal.][]

*assignment*

    Text(
      "These are wise words, enterprising men quote 'em.",
      style: DefaultTextStyle.of(context).style.apply(fontSizeFactor: 2.0),
    )

### Line height ###

By default, text will layout with line height as defined by the font. Font-metrics defined line height may be taller or shorter than the font size. The height property allows manual adjustment of the height of the line as a multiple of fontSize. For most fonts, setting height to 1.0 is not the same as omitting or setting height to null. The following diagram illustrates the difference between the font-metrics defined line height and the line height produced with `height: 1.0` (also known as the EM-square):

![Text height diagram][]

 *link* 

Sample

The height property can be used to change the line height. Here, the line height is set to 5 times the font size, so that the text is very spaced out. Since the `fontSize` is set to 10, the final height of the line is 50 pixels.

*assignment*

    Text(
      'Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but youâ€™re here with us in New York City.',
      style: TextStyle(height: 5, fontSize: 10),
    )

Examples of the resulting heights from different values of `TextStyle.height`:

![Text height comparison diagram][]

See StrutStyle for further control of line height at the paragraph level.

### Wavy red underline with black text ###

 *link* 

Sample

Styles can be combined. In this example, the misspelled word is drawn in black text and underlined with a wavy red line to indicate a spelling error. (The remainder is styled according to the Flutter default text styles, not the ambient DefaultTextStyle, since no explicit style is given and RichText does not automatically use the ambient DefaultTextStyle.)

![text_style_wavy_red_underline.png][]

*assignment*

    RichText(
      text: TextSpan(
        text: "Don't tax the South ",
        children: <TextSpan>[
          TextSpan(
            text: 'cuz',
            style: TextStyle(
              color: Colors.black,
              decoration: TextDecoration.underline,
              decorationColor: Colors.red,
              decorationStyle: TextDecorationStyle.wavy,
            ),
          ),
          TextSpan(
            text: ' we got it made in the shade',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    )

### Borders and stroke (Foreground) ###

 *link* 

Sample

To create bordered text, a Paint with Paint.style set to PaintingStyle.stroke should be provided as a foreground paint. The following example uses a Stack to produce a stroke and fill effect.

![Text border][]

*assignment*

    Stack(
      children: <Widget>[
        // Stroked text as border.
        Text(
          'Greetings, planet!',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 40,
            foreground: Paint()
              ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
              ..strokeWidth = 6
              ..color = Colors.blue[700],
          ),
        ),
        // Solid text as fill.
        Text(
          'Greetings, planet!',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 40,
            color: Colors.grey[300],
          ),
        ),
      ],
    )

### Gradients (Foreground) ###

 *link* 

Sample

The foreground property also allows effects such as gradients to be applied to the text. Here we provide a Paint with a ui.Gradient shader.

![Text gradient][]

*assignment*

    Text(
      'Greetings, planet!',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 40,
        foreground: Paint()
          ..shader = ui.Gradient.linear(
            const Offset(0, 20),
            const Offset(150, 20),
            <Color>[
              Colors.red,
              Colors.yellow,
            ],
          )
      ),
    )

### Custom Fonts ###

Custom fonts can be declared in the `pubspec.yaml` file as shown below:

    flutter:
      fonts:
        - family: Raleway
          fonts:
            - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
            - asset: fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
              weight: 500
            - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-SemiBold.ttf
              weight: 600
         - family: Schyler
           fonts:
             - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
             - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
               style: italic

The `family` property determines the name of the font, which you can use in the fontFamily argument. The `asset` property is a path to the font file, relative to the `pubspec.yaml` file. The `weight` property specifies the weight of the glyph outlines in the file as an integer multiple of 100 between 100 and 900. This corresponds to the FontWeight class and can be used in the fontWeight argument. The `style` property specifies whether the outlines in the file are `italic` or `normal`. These values correspond to the FontStyle class and can be used in the fontStyle argument.

To select a custom font, create TextStyle using the fontFamily argument as shown in the example below:

 *link* 

Sample

![text_style_custom_fonts.png][]

*assignment*

    const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway')

To use a font family defined in a package, the `package` argument must be provided. For instance, suppose the font declaration above is in the `pubspec.yaml` of a package named `my_package` which the app depends on. Then creating the TextStyle is done as follows:

    const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway', package: 'my_package')

If the package internally uses the font it defines, it should still specify the `package` argument when creating the text style as in the example above.

A package can also provide font files without declaring a font in its `pubspec.yaml`. These files should then be in the `lib/` folder of the package. The font files will not automatically be bundled in the app, instead the app can use these selectively when declaring a font. Suppose a package named `my_package` has:

    lib/fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf

Then the app can declare a font like in the example below:

    flutter:
      fonts:
        - family: Raleway
          fonts:
            - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
            - asset: packages/my_package/fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
              weight: 500

The `lib/` is implied, so it should not be included in the asset path.

In this case, since the app locally defines the font, the TextStyle is created without the `package` argument:

 *link* 

Sample

*assignment*

    const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway')

### Custom Font Fallback ###

A custom fontFamilyFallback list can be provided. The list should be an ordered list of strings of font family names in the order they will be attempted.

The fonts in fontFamilyFallback will be used only if the requested glyph is not present in the fontFamily.

The fallback order is:

 *  fontFamily
 *  fontFamilyFallback in order of first to last.
 *  System fallback fonts which will vary depending on platform.

The glyph used will always be the first matching version in fallback order.

The fontFamilyFallback property is commonly used to specify different font families for multilingual text spans as well as separate fonts for glyphs such as emojis.

 *link* 

Sample

In the following example, any glyphs not present in the font `Raleway` will be attempted to be resolved with `Noto Sans CJK SC`, and then with `Noto Color Emoji`:

*assignment*

    const TextStyle(
      fontFamily: 'Raleway',
      fontFamilyFallback: <String>[
        'Noto Sans CJK SC',
        'Noto Color Emoji',
      ],
    )

If all custom fallback font families are exhausted and no match was found or no custom fallback was provided, the platform font fallback will be used.

### Inconsistent platform fonts ###

Since Flutter's font discovery for default fonts depends on the fonts present on the device, it is not safe to assume all default fonts will be available or consistent across devices.

A known example of this is that Samsung devices ship with a CJK font that has smaller line spacing than the Android default. This results in Samsung devices displaying more tightly spaced text than on other Android devices when no custom font is specified.

To avoid this, a custom font should be specified if absolute font consistency is required for your application.
