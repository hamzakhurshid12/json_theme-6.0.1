# SingleChildScrollView class #

A box in which a single widget can be scrolled.

This widget is useful when you have a single box that will normally be entirely visible, for example a clock face in a time picker, but you need to make sure it can be scrolled if the container gets too small in one axis (the scroll direction).

It is also useful if you need to shrink-wrap in both axes (the main scrolling direction as well as the cross axis), as one might see in a dialog or pop-up menu. In that case, you might pair the SingleChildScrollView with a ListBody child.

When you have a list of children and do not require cross-axis shrink-wrapping behavior, for example a scrolling list that is always the width of the screen, consider ListView, which is vastly more efficient that a SingleChildScrollView containing a ListBody or Column with many children.

## Sample code: Using SingleChildScrollView with a Column ##

Sometimes a layout is designed around the flexible properties of a Column, but there is the concern that in some cases, there might not be enough room to see the entire contents. This could be because some devices have unusually small screens, or because the application can be used in landscape mode where the aspect ratio isn't what was originally envisioned, or because the application is being shown in a small window in split-screen mode. In any case, as a result, it might make sense to wrap the layout in a SingleChildScrollView.

Simply doing so, however, usually results in a conflict between the Column, which typically tries to grow as big as it can, and the SingleChildScrollView, which provides its children with an infinite amount of space.

To resolve this apparent conflict, there are a couple of techniques, as discussed below. These techniques should only be used when the content is normally expected to fit on the screen, so that the lazy instantiation of a sliver-based ListView or CustomScrollView is not expected to provide any performance benefit. If the viewport is expected to usually contain content beyond the dimensions of the screen, then SingleChildScrollView would be very expensive.

### Centering, spacing, or aligning fixed-height content ###

If the content has fixed (or intrinsic) dimensions but needs to be spaced out, centered, or otherwise positioned using the Flex layout model of a Column, the following technique can be used to provide the Column with a minimum dimension while allowing it to shrink-wrap the contents when there isn't enough room to apply these spacing or alignment needs.

A LayoutBuilder is used to obtain the size of the viewport (implicitly via the constraints that the SingleChildScrollView sees, since viewports typically grow to fit their maximum height constraint). Then, inside the scroll view, a ConstrainedBox is used to set the minimum height of the Column.

The Column has no Expanded children, so rather than take on the infinite height from its BoxConstraints.maxHeight, (the viewport provides no maximum height constraint), it automatically tries to shrink to fit its children. It cannot be smaller than its BoxConstraints.minHeight, though, and It therefore becomes the bigger of the minimum height provided by the ConstrainedBox and the sum of the heights of the children.

If the children aren't enough to fit that minimum size, the Column ends up with some remaining space to allocate as specified by its Column.mainAxisAlignment argument.

Interactive App Sample code

In this example, the children are spaced out equally, unless there's no more room, in which case they stack vertically and scroll.

When using this technique, Expanded and Flexible are not useful, because in both cases the "available space" is infinite (since this is in a viewport). The next section describes a technique for providing a maximum height constraint.

                       height: 120.0,
                       alignment: Alignment.center,
                       child: const Text('Fixed Height Content'),
                     ),
                     Container(
                       // Another fixed-height child.
                       color: const Color(0xff008000), // Green
                       height: 120.0,
                       alignment: Alignment.center,
                       child: const Text('Fixed Height Content'),
                     ),
                   ],
                 ),
               ),
             );
           },
         ),
       );
     }

### Expanding content to fit the viewport ###

The following example builds on the previous one. In addition to providing a minimum dimension for the child Column, an IntrinsicHeight widget is used to force the column to be exactly as big as its contents. This constraint combines with the ConstrainedBox constraints discussed previously to ensure that the column becomes either as big as viewport, or as big as the contents, whichever is biggest.

Both constraints must be used to get the desired effect. If only the IntrinsicHeight was specified, then the column would not grow to fit the entire viewport when its children were smaller than the whole screen. If only the size of the viewport was used, then the Column would overflow if the children were bigger than the viewport.

The widget that is to grow to fit the remaining space so provided is wrapped in an Expanded widget.

This technique is quite expensive, as it more or less requires that the contents of the viewport be laid out twice (once to find their intrinsic dimensions, and once to actually lay them out). The number of widgets within the column should therefore be kept small. Alternatively, subsets of the children that have known dimensions can be wrapped in a SizedBox that has tight vertical constraints, so that the intrinsic sizing algorithm can short-circuit the computation when it reaches those parts of the subtree.
